# pfda-r-programming
This project is about using R programming to explore and visualize the data trends in a employee attrition dataset with Data exploration, Data Preprocessing, and Data Analytics skills.

This module also allows me to explore not just the basic of R, but also how R is applied for data analysis purposes.

### Skills I learned in this module:
- Basic R programming using R studio
- Cross analysis to find out the main reason of employee attrition
- Exploring and visualize data trends and patterns
- Recommend actions to be taken by the company for reducing employee attrition
- Presentation skills of proposing an action plan


### Extra Features
1. Treemap with Treemapify package
    - Treemap allows to visualize hierarchical data in the form of nested rectangles.
    - It can often be seen as a tree structure with group and subgroup.
  
2. Fct_reorder() in Forcats package
    - fct_reorder() help to reorder values in ascending or descending order.
    - The forcats package is created to solve common problems with factors or categorical values.

3. Cut() and Difftime()
    - Cut function is used to create age group where it is useful in categorizing values of a continuous attribute like Age 
    - The Difftime function is used to calculate the difference between two date variables
